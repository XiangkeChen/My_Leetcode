This repo tracks all my leetcode solutions and my ideas.

I'll try to solve one problem using different approaches for some classical problems.

And I am major in Business Analytics. I am not very good at algorithm so that I might not be able to give the best solution, not mention a good time complexity. However, I'll try to do my best.

Hopefully, my solution and my notes can shed some light on you from some aspects.

For any question, feel free to contact me via fish_mylife@outlook.com
